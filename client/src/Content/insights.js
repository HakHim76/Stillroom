    title: "Attention is a trainable system",
    body: `Your ability to focus is not fixed. It is governed largely by the prefrontal cortex, the brain region responsible for executive control.

Each time you notice your mind wandering and gently bring it back to the task, you strengthen this circuit. That return is the repetition.

Try this: Work for 20 minutes. Every time you catch distraction, say “return” internally and resume. The return is the training.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Phones fragment attention",
    body: `Frequent phone checking trains your brain to seek novelty. Dopamine spikes reinforce task-switching, reducing your tolerance for sustained effort.

Over time, this lowers your baseline focus capacity.

Try this: Before a focus session, put your phone in another room. Not face down. Not silent. Physically out of reach.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Hydration affects cognition",
    body: `Even mild dehydration (1–2%) has been shown to reduce attention, memory performance, and mental clarity.

Your brain is highly sensitive to fluid balance.

Try this: Drink a glass of water before beginning focused work. It sounds small, but physiology compounds.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Exercise increases cognitive control",
    body: `Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain and elevates BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), which supports neural growth and learning.

Regular movement improves executive function and attention stability.

Try this: A 10–20 minute brisk walk before deep work often improves session quality.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Meditation builds attentional endurance",
    body: `Mindfulness meditation strengthens the same neural systems required for sustained attention.

Research shows consistent practice improves working memory and reduces mind wandering.

Try this: Sit for 5 minutes. Focus on your breath. When distracted, return. That return is the skill you use in work.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Context switching is cognitively expensive",
    body: `Switching between tasks carries a measurable cognitive cost. Residual attention lingers on the previous task, reducing performance on the next.

Deep work requires uninterrupted blocks.

Try this: Close all unrelated tabs. One task. One window. One intention.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Reflection consolidates learning",
    body: `Writing about what you did activates metacognition i.e thinking about your thinking. This strengthens memory consolidation and improves transfer of skill.

Without reflection, effort fades quickly.

Try this: After finishing work, write 3 sentences:
1) What did I attempt?
2) What worked?
3) What will I adjust next time?`,
  },
  {
    title: "Sleep determines focus capacity",
    body: `Sleep regulates attention, emotional control, and memory encoding. Even partial sleep deprivation significantly reduces sustained attention.

You cannot out-discipline biology.

Try this: Protect your sleep window. Depth tomorrow begins tonight.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Start small to reduce resistance",
    body: `Resistance is often emotional, not logical. Large tasks trigger avoidance.

Shrinking the first action reduces cognitive threat.

Try this: Instead of “Write report”, start with “Open document and write one paragraph.” Momentum follows.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Silence reduces cognitive load",
    body: `Background noise and constant audio stimulation keep your brain in reactive mode.

Silence lowers external input, increasing internal clarity.

Try this: Work in silence for one session today. No music. Notice the difference.`,
  },
